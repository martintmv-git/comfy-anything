# Comfy Anything Workflow Submission Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to submit your ComfyUI workflow requests to Comfy Anything. The key requirement is to organize your workflow files properly to avoid any confusion. Specifically, each workflow should be contained within its own folder, which will include a `workflow.json` file exported from ComfyUI.
